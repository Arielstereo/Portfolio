    "description": "Hello! I like web programming, especially the frontend. In 2021 I studied at the National Technological University (UTN), completing a diploma in full stack development, complementing self-taught with online courses (Udemy). At the beginning of 2022 I did an internship at the Equo company, where we developed the new website using Vue/Nuxt, Tailwind, Node, among other technologies. My dream is to join an IT company and continue training.",
